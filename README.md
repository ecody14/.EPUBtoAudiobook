# .Epub to Audiobook Converter

A Python-based tool that converts EPUB books into high-quality audiobooks using the VITS Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The system organizes the audiobook into chapters, with metadata support for playback as a "music album," ensuring a seamless and professional listening experience. Reminder, I am just a beginner and do not reccomend use of this software. This is for educationial purposes only!
